    "This tutorial was created by Ben Ochoa. We will use the Python programming language for  assignments in this course, with a few popular libraries (`NumPy`, `Matplotlib`). Assignments will be given in the format of web-based Jupyter notebook that you are currently viewing. We expect that many of you have some experience with `Python` and `NumPy`. If you have previous knowledge in `MATLAB`, check out the [NumPy for MATLAB users](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/numpy-for-matlab-users.html) page. The section below will serve as a quick introduction to `NumPy` and some other libraries."

Some basic use of this packages is shown below. This is **NOT** a problem, but you are highly recommended to run the following code with some of the input changed in order to understand the meaning of the operations."

    "## Problem 2: More Image Operations (45 points)\n",
    "\n",
    "In this problem you will reuse the image `ucsd-triton-statue.png`. Being a color image, this image has three channels, corresponding to the primary colors of red, green and blue. \n",
    "\n",
    "(1) Read the image.\n",
    "\n",
    "(2) Write your implementation to extract each of these channels separately to create single channel images. This means that from the $H\\times W\\times 3$ shaped image, you'll get three matrices of the shape $H\\times W$ (Note that it's 2-dimensional). \n",
    "\n",
    "(3) Now, write a function to merge all these single channel images back into a 3-dimensional colored image. Merge the 2D images using the original channels order (R,G,B) and the reversed channels order (B,G,R).\n",
    "\n",
    "(4) Next, write another function to mirror the original image from left to right. For this function, please only use **array indexing** to implement this function and **do not** directly use NumPy functions (such as `np.flip()`) that flip the matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "(5) Next, write another function to rotate the original image 90 degrees counterclockwise. For this function, please only use **array indexing** to implement this function and **do not** directly use NumPy functions (such as `np.rot90()`) that directly rotate the matrix. Try to apply the rotation function once (that is, a 90-degree rotation) and twice (that is, a 180-degree rotation).\n",
    "\n",
    "(6) Finally, consider **4 color images** you obtained: 2 from merging (RGB and BGR), 1 from mirroring (left to right) and 1 from rotation (180-degree). Using these 4 images, create one single image by tiling them together **without using loops**. The image will have $2\\times 2$ tiles making the shape of the final image $2H \\times 2W \\times 3$. The order in which the images are tiled does not matter. Show the tiled image."
